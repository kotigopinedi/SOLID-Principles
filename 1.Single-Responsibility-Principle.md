# SOLID Principles

The **SOLID** principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers create more maintainable, scalable, and flexible software. These principles were introduced by **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)** and aim to improve code readability, reusability, and testability.


## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
### **1. Identify Responsibilities**

 **Responsibilities of the `OrderProcessor` Class**

The `OrderProcessor` class currently handles multiple responsibilities:

-   **Price Calculation** – Computes the total price, including taxes and discounts.
-   **Order Persistence** – Saves order details to the database.
-   **Notification Handling** – Sends an order confirmation email to the customer.

 **Problems with Multiple Responsibilities**

Having multiple responsibilities in one class violates the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and leads to:

-   **Tightly Coupled Code** – Changes in one responsibility (e.g., modifying tax calculations) can unintentionally affect others (e.g., database logic).
-   **Difficult Maintenance** – The class grows large and complex, making it hard to modify or debug.
-   **Limited Reusability** – If another part of the system needs email notifications, it would require unnecessary dependencies on order processing.
-   **Harder Testing** – Unit testing becomes more difficult because it involves multiple concerns.

### **Proposed Refactor: Splitting `OrderProcessor` into Multiple Classes**

To adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and improve maintainability, we can split `OrderProcessor` into the following distinct classes:

#### **1. `OrderProcessor` (Coordinator Class)**

-   Acts as the main entry point for processing an order.
-   Delegates tasks to specialized classes.
-   Ensures a smooth flow from price calculation to saving the order and sending notifications.

#### **2. `PriceCalculator` (Handles Pricing Logic)**

-   Computes the total price of an order, including:
    -   Applying discounts
    -   Calculating taxes
    -   Handling additional charges (e.g., shipping fees)

#### **3. `OrderRepository` (Handles Database Operations)**

-   Saves the order details to the database.
-   Retrieves order details when needed.
-   Ensures data integrity and persistence.

#### **4. `EmailNotification` (Handles Customer Notifications)**

-   Sends an order confirmation email to the customer.
-   Could be extended to handle SMS or push notifications.

### **Justification**

-   **SRP Compliance**: Each class has a well-defined responsibility, making the code more **modular** and **easier to maintain**.
-   **Improved Testability**: Each class can be tested independently, reducing complexity in unit tests.
-   **Scalability**: New features (e.g., adding SMS notifications or a new tax calculation method) can be implemented **without modifying the core order processing logic**.
-   **Flexibility**: Developers can replace or extend functionalities without impacting unrelated parts of the system.
