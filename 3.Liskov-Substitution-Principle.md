# SOLID Principles

The **SOLID** principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers create more maintainable, scalable, and flexible software. These principles were introduced by **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)** and aim to improve code readability, reusability, and testability.


## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

### **1. Analyze the Violation**

The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** states that subclasses should be able to replace their base class **without altering expected behavior**. `CodPayment` violates LSP because its `pay()` method does **not actually process a payment** like `CreditCardPayment` or `PayPalPayment`. Instead of immediately charging the customer, it **only marks the order as "Pending Payment"**, which changes the expected contract of `pay()`. If existing code expects `pay()` to always process a transaction but receives a `CodPayment` instance instead, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

### **2. Propose a Better Design**

Instead of forcing `CodPayment` to inherit from `PaymentMethod`, we can introduce a separate interface or base class for **delayed payments**.

#### **Refactored Design**

1.  **Extract an Interface `OnlinePaymentMethod`**
    
    -   Defines `pay()` for payment methods that process transactions immediately.
    -   `CreditCardPayment` and `PayPalPayment` implement this.
2.  **Introduce a New Interface `DeferredPaymentMethod`**
    
    -   Defines `markPendingPayment()` for payments that are **collected later**.
    -   `CodPayment` implements this instead of overriding `pay()`.

### **3. Reasoning**

Our revised approach ensures **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) compliance** by clearly separating **immediate payment methods** (e.g., credit cards, PayPal) from **deferred payment methods** (e.g., cash on delivery, pay later). This way, any code expecting an `OnlinePaymentMethod` can confidently call `pay()` without encountering unexpected behavior from `CodPayment`, which does not process payments immediately. Similarly, deferred payment types correctly implement `confirmPayment()`, ensuring they follow their intended workflow. This structured design allows **seamless substitution of subclasses within their respective categories**, making the system **scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to new payment methods** without modifying existing logic.
